# Quiz Application

## Description

This project is a **Quiz Application** where users can answer a set of questions. The application provides immediate feedback on the answers by highlighting them in green if correct and red if incorrect. If the user skips a question, it is classified as a "skipped answer." At the end of the quiz, the app calculates and displays the percentage of correct, incorrect, and skipped answers. Additionally, it shows each question along with the answer the user provided.
